# Project Mimic (Optional)

Project Mimic (Optional) is a decentralized social trading platform that uses [Opyn v1](https://v1.opyn.co) and [Opyn v2](https://opyn.co) as the underlying on the Ethereum network. 

Optional allows option traders to become social traders or follow other social traders. Social traders on the platform can charge followers a fee to follow their moves whether by entry fee or a small profit cut.

Followers can limit their risk to certain moves, such as:
- Calls
- Puts
- Long
- Short
- Credit Spreads
- Debit Spreads

As an alternative, Optional can act as a secondary frontend. Ability to convert premiums to a choice of token or to straight up Ether. In addition, the ability to create your own option chains.
