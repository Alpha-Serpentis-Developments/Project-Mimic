# Project Mimic (Optional)

**(This branch is v1! The released v0 product is at this branch https://github.com/Alpha-Serpentis-Developments/Project-Mimic/tree/v0.1)**

Project Mimic (Optional) is a decentralized social trading platform that uses [Opyn v1](https://v1.opyn.co) and [Opyn v2](https://opyn.co) as the underlying on the Ethereum network. 

Optional allows option traders to become social traders or follow other social traders. Social traders on the platform can charge followers a fee to follow their moves whether by entry fee or a small profit cut.

Each social trading token has a unique style based on the trader's strategies. Followers can limit their risk to certain traders or tokens based on their predetermined moves.
