# Security

Optional is committed to providing users with a secure experience. We do our due-diligence and thoroughly review our code for optimizations and bugs, especially with our smart contracts.

## Security Audit

Currently, Optional is not formally audited by any smart contract auditing firm. In the future, we do intend on requesting a formal audit.

Exercise caution when using our products.

## Supported Smart Contract Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.2 (Mercury)   | :x: |
| 0.2.x (Venus)   | :white_check_mark: |

## Supported Frontend Versions

Our frontends aren't necessarily versioned, but as long as they have an active URL (like test.optional.finance), then the vulnerability should be reported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT USE GITHUB ISSUES OR ANY SOCIAL CHANNELS TO REPORT A VULNERABILITY!**

Any vulnerability or bug discovered must be reported only to the following email:

[security@optional.finance](mailto:security@optional.finance)

When reporting a vulnerability or bug, please ensure to provide as much information as possible, including:

- The conditions in which the bug was reproduced
- The required steps to reproduce it or proof of concept
    - Ensure the testing environment is completely isolated; public testnets do not count!

After reporting, you may not publicly disclose the bug until all of the following conditions have been met:

- We've approved to publicly disclose it
- Issued a patch and safely migrated OR the bug has been deemed to not affect operations
